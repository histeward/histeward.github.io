    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
    Go v1.22 was released back in February 2024, It introduced some really great improvements on the <b>net/http</b>
    standard library to the <b>net/http.ServeMux</b> type. Routing in go is more expressive and now supports nice to have
    things like method based routing and wildcards.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    As for previous versions of Go, you could use other libraries like chi or gorilla mux that had the functionality built-in.
    Of course you could implement this yourself, but it's nice to have a good set of tools at your disposal.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2 id="mbr">Method based routing</h2>
    <p>
    As of now, the standard library is all you really need to start writing api's in go.
    Before go v1.22 to handle different http methods you could write a check inside of the handler function. Which can be a
    bit mundane to write each time.
    </p>
    <br>
    <div class="code-box">
        <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">copy</button>
        <pre><code class="language-go">// handler example before go v1.22
func FilterById(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	if r.Method == http.MethodGet {
		// Handle get requests
	} else if r.Method == http.MethodDelete {
		// Handle delete requests
}</code></pre>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
    Now you can specify HTTP methods directly in the pattern of a route. 
    This ensures requests like <b>DELETE /posts/{id}</b> fail if not
    handled properly, responding with a 405 method not allowed.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Let's make a simple http server using go v1.22 to demonstration. We import the <b>fmt</b> and <b>net/http</b> library, define our handler
    that returns a confirmation when the method aligns with what's specified in the route pattern, define a route that
    handles DELETE requests to the "/resource" endpoint, initialise our server and run our it. Make sure that you have go
    version 1.22 specified in your go.mod file for it to work.
    </p>
    <br>
    <div class="code-box">
        <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">copy</button>
        <pre><code class="language-go">// after go v1.22
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func handleResource(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Method %s Accepted", r.Method)
}

func main() {
    router := http.NewServeMux()
    router.HandleFunc("DELETE /resource", handleResource)

    server := http.Server {
        Addr: ":8080",
        Handler: router,
    }

	fmt.Println("Server is running on port 8080")
	server.ListenAndServe()
}</code></pre>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
    Now we can send a curl request with the GET method and it should return "Method Not Allowed". 
    If you send a request with the correct method, it should return "Method DELETE Accepted".
    </p>
    <br>
    <div class="code-box">
        <pre><code class="language-bash"># curl request with incorrect method
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/resource

Method Not Allowed

# curl request with correct method
$ curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/resource

Method DELETE Accepted
</code></pre>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2 id="wr">Wildcards</h2>
    <p>
    If it comes to wildcards go allows us to now specify what we want to capture within curly brackets.
    Here we implement a wildcard segment {id} e.g "POST /resource/{id}".
    We use the r.PathValue("id") function inside the handler to capture the value of the {id} wildcard from the request path.
    Based on the HTTP method, the handler returns the appropriate success status code and message.
    </p>

	switch r.Method {
	case "POST":
		w.WriteHeader(http.StatusCreated)
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "Resource %s created", id)
	case "PUT":
		w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "Resource %s updated", id)
	default:
		http.Error(w, "Method Not Allowed", http.StatusMethodNotAllowed)

}
