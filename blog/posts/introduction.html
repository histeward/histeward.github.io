    <h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    This is where I write about my interests, experiences and projects. This
    blog is also my own solution where the functionality is written in plain
    HTML, CSS and Javascript. Although I could have just used a CMS (Content
    Management System) like Squarespace, Wordpress or wix. But I think a
    dynamic blog application is still far cooler especially since I can build it
    myself.
